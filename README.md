# Snake
Simple game "Snake" write with SFML for grapfhics and additional lib for read from .json files.

In the <Resources Config> folder, the paths to the textures of the buttons, the font of the inscriptions, the sidebar of the hood are registered.

The <Lvls> folder contains files with the level parameters: width and height, snake start position, paths to the snake, apple, wall and water textures.
Also here is the description of the level map (key <Map>). You can prescribe the level map yourself (keep an eye on the equality of the length and width prescribed above). Use the following symbols to create a map:
B - Wall texture,
W - Water texture,
F - Flor texture

You can change resource files and their paths to catatomize the game yourself. Textures and sprites should resize automatically.
